# Rupert
Meet Rupert. The crypto butler that has an attitude.

I suggest just copying the contents of the 'rupert.sh" file and saving them to a file of the same name in a folder containing the daemons you intend to use. 

next you do what every entitled person with a servant does and..

`bash rupert.sh`

first you must choose the daemon to interact with. ex: "bitcoin-cli", "fckbankscoind", "dogecoin-cli"

*TIP* *make sure to spell the name of the wallet right and include the "cli" or "d"*

next you have options:

BLOCK_NUM --> search for a blockhash by index number

BLOCKHASH --> serch for block by using the blockhash

GET_TX --> search for transactions by tx#

PEERS --> getpeerinfo

BALANCE --> getbalance

NEW_ADDRESS --> getnewaddress

SEND --> send to another address

CHOOSE_NEW --> choose new wallet to interact with

QUIT --> stop beating rupert

It's simple... I know.. he has an attitude... I know.. but hey... it works...
